      <h3>AI Engineering Intern | Ally Financial</h3>
      <p>I joined the Conversational AI team last summer to work on improving the deposits chatbot.
        Specifically, I built an application in Streamlit to help developers analyze the performance of the
        chatbot using NLU analysis tools. I then packaged that application using Docker, hobbies-and-interests
        deployed the application using AWS and GitLab's CI/CD pipeline on Ally's internal network.

      <h3>Actuarial Modeling Intern | Allianz Life</h3>
      <p>As part of the Modeling team, I helped maintain and improve the financial models for Allianz's life 
        insurance products. As an intern, I also worked on a project to transfer a model for a product from the 
        previous platform into the current platform, working in languages such as c++, Python, and SQL.

      <h3>EECS 280 Instructional Aide | University of Michigan College of Engineering</h3>
      <p>EECS 280 is one of the foundational Computer Science courses at UofM. As an IA, I 
        helped students in office hours debug code and work through projects. I led a 2 hour
        lab once a week where I reviewed lecture material, and assisted students as they worked
        through group assignments. In 1-1 coaching sessions, I helped students understand
        essential class concepts as well as providing tips for success in the class. Lastly, as 
        head of the Cheat-Checking team, I help discover instances of honor code violations in student work, 
        and write reports detailing the violations.
